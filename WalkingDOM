// WALKING THE DOM

/* 
The DOM allows us to do anything with elements and their contents, but first we need to reach the corresponding DOM object.


According to the W3C HTML DOM standard, everything in an HTML document is a node:

The entire document is a document node
Every HTML element is an element node
The text inside HTML elements are text nodes
Every HTML attribute is an attribute node (deprecated)
All comments are comment nodes
